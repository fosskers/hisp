; Project Euler Problem 5
; What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of
; the numbers from 1 to 20?

; SOLUTION: 232792560
; Interesting. This solution actually satisfies up to 22.

; Theory: (x1, x2, x3, .. xn) are primes and are factors of y.
; (* x1 x2 x3 .. xn) is also a factor of y.

; Holds for (2,3) (3,5) (5,7) (7,11) (11,13) (13,17) (17,19) (2,5) (2,3,5)

(require "../prelude.hisp")

; Iterate by this amount. Allows us to only need to test 24 numbers.
